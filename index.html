		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>HI! I'm <em>Jeffrey Pohlmann</em>, but I go by "JP". I've been developing web sites since the very begining in 1995. I love modern CSS, and all the things it can do. I also enjoy JavaScript. I also love dogs, electronic music, and 3D printing.</p>
		<p>I'm pretty easy to talk to. Choose your favorite method:</p>
